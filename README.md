# Titanic EDA: Exploratory Data Analysis

This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset, which contains data about passengers aboard the Titanic, to uncover insights and patterns that could potentially help in predicting survival chances. The dataset is a well-known example in data science and machine learning.

The goal of this project is to:
- Clean and preprocess the data.
- Visualize key patterns and relationships.
- Generate insights that may be useful for further analysis or predictive modeling.
